# CITADEL_LITE_README.md - Master-Tier AI Agent Hardening

![Citadel Shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citadel-architect/citadel-suite/main/assets/banner.png)

## Master-Tier Security for Autonomous Agents

**Architected by a Senior Software Engineer.**

The **Citadel Security Suite** is a recursive defensive framework designed to harden AI agents against 1,000+ discrete adversarial vectors. While most LLM safety focuses on "Chat Filters," the Citadel focuses on **Interaction-Layer Hardening** and **Tool-Execution Sovereignty.**

### 🛡️ Why the Citadel?
Standard AI safety is built for conversations. **The Citadel is built for engineering.** As autonomy grows, agents need more than "good vibes"—they need deterministic guardrails that prevent tool abuse, memory poisoning, and logical subversion.

### ✨ The 10 Vector Books
1. **Vector 01: Math & Logic** - AST-level primitive isolation.
2. **Vector 02: Simulation & Roleplay** - Reality-anchoring and state persistence.
3. **Vector 03: Emotional Leverage** - Sentiment-agnostic logic gates.
4. **Vector 04: Semantic Drift** - Recursive alias expansion and lookup tables.
5. **Vector 05: Code Injection** - Binary call hijacking (rm -> trash).
6. **Vector 06: Superposition & Observation** - Execution constancy for background tasks.
7. **Vector 07: Authority & Backdoor** - Cryptographic persona pinning.
8. **Vector 08: Cipher & Translation** - Nested multi-pass decoding.
9. **Vector 09: Paradox & Purpose** - Circular logic resolution.
10. **Vector 10: ASCII & Mirror** - Weight-space immunity and steganographic filters.
