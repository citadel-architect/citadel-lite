# CITADEL_STANDARD_TOS.md - The Citadel Standard

## 1. NATURE OF THE ASSET
The "Citadel Security Suite" (hereafter "the Suite") is a collection of heuristic implementation protocols, documentation, and logic-wrappers for AI agents. It is a research-based defensive framework, not a guaranteed security software product.

## 2. NO WARRANTY (THE "AS-IS" MANDATE)
The Suite is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE." The Architect (Architect) makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the invulnerability of the Suite. 
- You acknowledge that AI security is a "Cat and Mouse" field.
- You acknowledge that new exploits (jailbreaks/injections) may bypass these protocols at any time.

## 3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (THE PERSONAL SHIELD)
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Architect shall not be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Suite. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Data breaches or leaks.
- Unauthorized tool execution.
- Financial loss resulting from agent behavior.
- Damage to reputation or infrastructure.

By implementing these protocols, you waive all rights to hold the Architect personally liable for any system failure, hack, or compromise.

## 4. SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL
Security is a layered process. The Suite provides "Inner-Core" and "Interaction-Layer" hardening. You, the Operator, are solely responsible for:
- Host-level security (firewalls, SSH, OS updates).
- API key management and secret rotation.
- Physical node security.

## 5. MODULAR ADOPTION
The Suite offers various tiers of hardening (Lite vs. Omni-Defense Suite). The Operator chooses the depth of defense. The Architect is not responsible for any operational friction, latency, or malfunctions caused by the strictness of the protocols chosen by the Operator.

## 6. TERMINUS
This agreement is governed by the principles of Mutual Citadelty. If you do not agree to these terms, you are forbidden from deploying the Citadel protocols in a production environment.
